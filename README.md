## Change light intensity and colour based on sound and movement. 

### Kinect info
Kinekt uses skeleton and joints. We can trigger changes in the light by calculating various distances between the joints.
Sample: 
1. hands to head -> Green
2. hands to shoulders -> Orange
3. Hands to hips -> Red


### JointType enum
You can use the jointtype enum to run for references to the different joint types.
